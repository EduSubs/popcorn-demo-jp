1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,720
Sine the beginning of this year, 2011,

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,960
even before the nuclear accident occurred,

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,760
something important had been going on.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,080
For example in hte Middle East...

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:33,040
Things have been happeing in Egypt, Tunisia, and other places.

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,240
People's revolutions have been rewriting the map of the Middle East.

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,680
My friends and I were curious about

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,840
how this transformation of the Middle East

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:54,040
will transform the world or the world order.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,040
I was thinking about how the Egyptian revolution

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,840
would have an impact on East Asia, America, and Japan.

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,080
Only 2 months have passed since the earthquake,

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,320
Now I think a transformation is likely to take place here as well.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,560
Only 2 months have passed since the earthquake, 

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,360
and I haven't seen a bit change in our society. 

16
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,840
But our minds may have changed. 

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,320
Before, we never imagined Japan disappearing,

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,000
even if we had a serious recession. 

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,680
We still thought thing would go on. 

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,320
But, this time we've learnt nothing is certain.

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,640
We don't even know if we can continue to live in Tokyo,

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,840
though many prentend not to think about this. 

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,480
We've learnt nothing goes on permanently.

24
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,760
Things can change, and changes are happening.

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,520
That's why many people are gathering and rallying. 

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,440
Things may be changing.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800


28
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,360
Let's keep making noise until we will stop all the nuclear power plants! 

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,000
It is us who will be the ones to stop all those facilities!

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,800
Today our protest is going to cut across Shibuya, 

31
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,520
so this will be awesome.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,560
Let's hold our heads up high, make our voices heard, and have fun!

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,360
Let's make today a great day and stop all nuclear power plants! 

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,360
Ran, are you afraid of nuclear power plants?

35
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,520
Are you afraid of nuclear power plants?

36
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,120
Ran!

37
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,560
Are you afraid of nuclear power plants?
