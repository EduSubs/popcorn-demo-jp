00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,104
Modern [defn]PSY > psychology[/defn] has a word that is probably used more

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,573
than any other word in psychology.

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:09,810
It is a word "maladjusted".

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,999
This is the ringing cry of modern child psychology.

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,283
Maladjusted

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,520
Now, of course we all want to live the well adjusted life

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,824
in order to avoid neurotic and schizophrenic personalities.

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,827
As I moved towards my conclusion

9
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:31,832
I would like to say to you today in very honest manner,

10
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:37,070
there´re some things in our [defn]SOC > society[/defn] and some things in our world

11
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:41,108
which I´m proud to be maladjusted.

12
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,544
And I call upon all men of good will

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,879
to be maladjusted to these things

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,049
until the good society´s realized.

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,153
I must honestly say to you that I never intend to adjust myself

16
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:57,791
to racial segregation and [defn]DISC > discrimination[/defn].

17
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:03,597
I never intend to adjust myself to religious bigotry.

18
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,868
I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions

19
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:12,873
that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few,

20
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:15,742
leave millions of God´s children smothering

21
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:20,411
in an air-tight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society.
